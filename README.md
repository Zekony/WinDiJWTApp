 ## Content

 Basically this app uses jwt tokens to communicate with backend server of the company i made this app for.

 ## How it works
The app can be accessed using a phone number, followed by a registration process where users are required to provide some basic information. Upon successful registration, users are directed to their profile screen, where they can further complete their profile details and select an avatar from their phone's gallery. All provided data is securely transmitted to the server and stored locally on the device. Upon subsequent app launches, user data is retrieved from the device. In the event of data loss, it will be automatically reloaded from the server.
